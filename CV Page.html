       I was born in Bern, on the 21st of April, 1999. My marital status is single. I graduated in South Korea, in Seoul Foreign School, where after taking part in the International Baccalaureate, I gained my IB Diploma. I speak both French and English fluently, having learned them at a young age, and Hungarian as well, as it is my mother tongue. I have stayed abroad for 6 years in Belgium, 2 years in Australia, and 3 years in South Korea, due to my father’s job. During my childhood, I took interest and looked into many different subject, such as history, theatre, psychology, visual arts, physics and more. I would love to read about famous experiments trying to unveil the inner workings of the human mind, to study the historical events that shaped the world we live in now, or the physical laws that dictate the way the universe functions. I took part in theatre performances, most notable the Odyssey, a play that was performed before the entire high school. When I started working during my gap year, I realized just how much the subject of computing actually interests me I was employed by Unisys, a global information technology company, where I worked as a service desk agent.

       The job would require constantly solving IT related problems that the caller experiences, going from a simple locked account, to an entirely crippled software (or a broken keyboard). This experience made me come into closer contact with computers than I have ever been, and was a big part in kindling my passion for the subject. Thanks to my father's job, I have grown up in many different parts of the world, going to school in Belgium, Australia, my native Hungary, and most recently graduating in South Korea. In all these different parts of the world, I have experienced and lived in many different cultures, and learned to see the world through different points of view. I now speak three languages (Hungarian, French, English) and can safely say that this multicultural background only helped to feed my curiosity, as well as my love for traveling and the world at large. This is part of the reason I wanted to study in the British Isles. My entire life, I have always moved from one country to the next, and moving there just seemed like a natural next step for me to take. Academically, I have shown myself to be focused and determined learner, driven by my curiosity. I am also attentive to details, and like to know what to expect, which means that I am not afraid to ask questions when something seems unclear. I like to keep my options open, so that I can always pursue that which interests me the most. I also enjoy working in groups, and like to make sure everyone is included in the decision making process. In the end, you could say that I am curious man, going after their interests.
