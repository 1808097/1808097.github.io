     <h3 id=item1>Company Employment</h3>
     <p>
       For a year in Budapest, I was under the employment of Unisys, a global information technology company. There I worked as a service desk agent, helping user to solve their IT related issues. The job consisted of sitting on the phone, and taking calls form employees that are having technical difficulties, be they a simple locked account, or a crippled softer, or accidentally deleted folders. This job truly helped me to hone my problem solving skills, as well as my ability to communicate and cooperate successfully with others, especially those under stress. I can safely say that my time there was very productive, I will apply the lessons I learned there in the future.

     <h3 id=item2>Charity Work</h3>
     <p>
      While I was in South Korea, I took part in several efforts of charity. One of them initiated by the environmental club, and involved raising money for charity trough a bake sale. I helped to set up the stand and sell the pastries to the rest of the student body. Another was an effort initiated by the knitting club, with their goal being to send knitted hats to help children in Africa who die from cold during the night. Both of these events taught me how to work better in groups, and to cooperate together with others towards a common goal. They were also a very good exercise in making in plan in how to achieve an abstract goal, such as, for example, how to help the environment, or communities suffering from poverty worldwide. They also showed me that with a little bit of creativity and determination, it is possible to help with issue that one would be tempted to think are too large and out of reach for you to possibly affect. This lesson is one that I always keep in mind, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to learn by helping others.

     <h3 id=item3>School Help</h3>
     <p>
      In Korea, I took part in a group project that I had initiated with some of my classmates. The project consisted of helping to keep the school cleaner by picking up trash after school in the courtyard. The school had vary large outdoor facilities that were user by the whole student body, and despite this, trash was frequently visible outside. For this project we coordinated with the schools cleaning crew, asking for their schedule so that we would not be bothering each other or rendering each other’s work pointless. The project was a success, and it seemed that as time when on, we picked up less and less trash. This experience was a great opportunity to learn both how to start and execute a project with others, but also how to coordinate with other people. I am grateful for all the help I received, and I glad I could make a difference.

     <h3 id=item4>Teaching assistance</h3>
     <p>
       Back in high school, I took it upon myself to assist an organization to help teach others English. In Korea, it is common for everyone to learn English, and some organization take it upon themselves to teach children English. During my time I taught and spoke with others in English, and also assisted teachers in teaching English. My time helped me not only to hone my English skills further, but also to explain and assist others, be it teaching or learning. This also helped me to get more acquainted with Korean culture, as I would interact with Koreans frequently. The time I took teaching others English help me to learn to appreciate helping others, as well as develop a love for teaching other people. Coming into contact with teachers and helping them has also helped me to both observe and pick up some teaching skills, and how to apply them properly. Overall, I am grateful for this opportunity, and learned much form it.
