       <h3 id=item1>Belgium</h3>
       <p>
         I have lived in the city of Brussels when I was but a child, but it has nevertheless left a big impression on me. The first and most obvious is that it is where I learned the French language, which I still speak perfectly to this day. Learning this language, and living the Belgian capital, has helped me to receive a very close and personal experience of “Francophone” culture. This was my first real dive into another culture, and was a decisive factor in helping me learn how to adapt and work others who are different from me, or come from a different background. The calm and friendly attitude of my classmates, mentors and teachers has also helped me to learn how to work better with others, and to keep morale up in stressful situations. In conclusion, my time there was as productive as it was enjoyable, and I hold Brussels close to my heart.

       <h3 id=item2>Seoul</h3>
       <p>
         My time spend in Seoul was recent, but I can guarantee that I will not forget it anytime soon. Seoul is by far the most different of the cities I have lived in, and also one of the most impressive. It is there that I graduated from high school, and as a result is where I matured, be it through my teachers or through tough experiences, my attitude towards learning in an academic setting. I can say that Seoul was an excellent teacher in this regard, and its reputation for harsh school life in not undeserved. But I also learned invaluable lessons in working with others. In this land where I did not speak the language, it was often a challenge to speak with people who are from a very different culture from you. I can safely day that my time there was as busy as the streets of Seoul, but I have obtained many valuable lessons from there, and remember this city fondly.

       <h3 id=item3>Canberra</h3>
       <p>
         Canberra will long hold a very special place in my heart. I was there during my early teenage years, and it was there that I grew a true appreciation for nature and all its beauties. But it is also most importantly where I learned English, the language I am now the most skilled at using, due to its none-stop use since I learned it. The acquisition of this language has helped me to widen my cultural horizons even more, and opened the door to the entire world for me. I am writing in English even now, after all. Australia was also a true melting pot of different cultures, and it has helped me to meet and interact with many different people from many different cultures. It is also here that thanks to the tutelage of my teachers, I honed my interest in the sciences and mathematics, and admittedly also where I acquired my distaste for economics. In conclusion, my time there is something I will always remember fondly, and I hope to visit it again someday.

       <h3 id=item4>Budapest</h3>
       <p>
        As my city of origin, it would be expected that my relationship with this city runs deep. Despite it not being the place of my birth, it is the city where I grew up, and I would constantly visit it, no matter where I currently was. Budapest is the city that taught me maturity, and also where I learned how to work efficiently on any project that I may be assigned. It was also in this city where I acquired my first job, where I worked for a year. That experience was pivotal for learning about the working world, and to understand what it meant to be a productive part of society. It was also obviously an opportunity to learn how to carry responsibility, and how to carry your mistakes. My colleagues and superiors were also very helpful, and helped me to develop on my cooperation skills even further. In conclusion, Budapest is my hometown, and I carry a little bit of it no matter where I go, and can only hope it will anchor me for the foreseeable future.
