           <th id="item1">Game Project</th>
           <th>This project involved the creation of a game, together with the rules and any material needed for it. I worked on this project back in school with my classmates, and in the end, I can say that this project was a complete success. This project taught me important skills in regards to communicating with others to work on a large project, as well as time management, to make sure everyone was done with everything in time. This one of my first large projects, and prepared me well for those to come.

           <th id="item2">Fall Play Project</th>
           <th>This project consisted of my involvement with the fall play at my high school. The play in question was “The Odyssey”, and was a long and arduous project. We practised for over several weeks, learning lines and repeating scenes, with the stage getting more and more props after each day. In the end, this was both a great practise for leaning lines, but also a unique and very interesting look at what happens behind the scenes of a theatre play. It was also a great opportunity to work closely with the other actors, revising scenes, and practising our acting. In conclusion, I was very glad to be a part of this production and it is a memory I will long keep in my heart.

           <th id="item3">Psychology Project</th>
           <th>This project consisted of reproduction a famous psychology experiment, and then to analyse our data, and see if our results matched those of the original, or if they didn’t, what were the differences that caused this. In my group, we reproduced the experiment of Loftus and Palmet (1974), which consisted of asking two groups how fast a car was going in a video, but with the wording varying in the question of the two groups. This project improved my group working skills further, and also taught me how to gather data in a scientific way. This group project was very interesting, and I am glad to have taken part in it.

           <th id="item4">Field Project</th>
           <th>For our science class, we had a whole day where we would head out to a park to gather data, and we were put into groups to design our project. Our group decided to measure how different surfaces would affect the height of a bouncy ball. Despite the simplistic experiment, making it so our data would be reliable takes a great deal of preparation, and we needed to show great precision. Overall, this project was a great opportunity to work with others in a group, and also taught me how to design an experiment in a scientific manner, and also to apply that to real life by gathering our own data. In conclusion, this was a very fun project that taught me a lot, and I am glad to have been part of it.

           <th id="item5">Work Project</th>
           <th>While I was working in Budapest, I had the opportunity to take part in a program where I could help to train new recruits of the company. Having been new myself, I took this opportunity to help others so I could make the harsh first few weeks easier of others, as well as improve my teaching skills. One of the main activities we had to take care of was the practise calls. Since our job was that of a service desk agent, receiving calls as practise form the real thing was a common practise. Making these calls involved acting like a helpless user trying to fix a problem. Overall, this project was an interesting experience that helped me to put my own job into perspective, and also assist others to do the same. I am glad to have been part of it.

           <th id="item6">Theater Project</th>
           <th>During my higher level theatre course in high school, one of the assignment we had to do as a class was to make an entire play from scratch. This projects was one that stretched over a long time, and we split the work between our classmates. I was in charge of lighting together with a classmate. In the end, the play was a large success, despite how difficult it was to prepare it. This project helped me to learn how to work together with others, and also how to make and plan a large project from scratch. This also provided me with a keen insight into the making if a theatre play, and helped me to practise my acting skills, as well as my ability to memorize lines. In conclusion, this was a very memorable project, and I am glad to have been a part of it.
